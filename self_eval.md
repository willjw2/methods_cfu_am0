# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
> I feel pretty confident in what we've learned of Ruby methods

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
> I feel confident writing simple methods of my own

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
> Can you have a method within another method, and what would that be useful for? I should experiment with this myself later.
